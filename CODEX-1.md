# Codex-1
A codex is a document that describes a problem and its solution

### 1. Problem
We have no distributed problem-solving methodology

### 2. Solution
Create a codex that will allow to solve problems in a distributed fashion

#### 2.1 Passive rules
- A user can request a codex creation by creating an Issue. Each such issue should be interpreted as "I might have a problem that you might can solve and I will pay for it". The issue should contain a problem description in a free form.
